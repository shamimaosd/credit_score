# Classifying The Credit Scores

## Project Overview
This project aims to develop a machine learning model to predict individuals' credit scores based on their financial and credit-related information. The objective is to automate and enhance the credit scoring process using intelligent systems in a global finance company.

## Tasks and Methodology

### 1. Dataset Download
- Obtained a dataset containing relevant credit-related information.
- Key features include:
  - Income
  - Outstanding debt
  - Credit history
- Target variable identified as `Credit_Mix`.

### 2. Data Exploration and Preprocessing
- Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand feature distributions and the target variable.
- Handled missing values, outliers, and data inconsistencies.
- Encoded categorical variables where necessary.
- Explored the distribution of the target variable.

### 3. Model Selection
Selected suitable machine learning classification models for predicting credit scores, including:
- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest Classifier
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Gradient Boosting Classifier (e.g., XGBoost)

### 4. Model Training
- Trained each selected model using the training dataset.
- Utilized evaluation metrics suitable for classification tasks, including accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and confusion matrix.

### 5. Hyperparameter Tuning
- Conducted hyperparameter tuning for at least one model using techniques like Grid Search or Random Search.
- Provided explanations for the chosen hyperparameters and their significance.

### 6. Model Evaluation
- Assessed the performance of each model on the testing set.
- Discussed strengths and limitations of each model in the context of credit score classification.

### 7. Interpretability
- Explored methods to interpret model decisions and understand factors influencing credit score classifications.

### 8. Code Submission
- The repository contains well-commented and organized code for each phase of the project, along with comprehensive documentation for review.
